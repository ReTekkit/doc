# ReTekkit Documentation

Hello and welcome! Here you can find information about ReTekkit, its mods, and whatever else you may want.

To edit the documentation, I highly recommend using [ObsidanMD](https://obsidian.md/). When you clone this repo, the default settings should automatically install the Git plugin, but if not, I recommend downloading it from the `Community Plugins` section in the app's settings.

You may also edit it by hand, everything here uses Markdown!
